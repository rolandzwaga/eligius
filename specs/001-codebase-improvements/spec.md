# Feature Specification: Codebase Quality Improvement Initiative

**Feature Branch**: `001-codebase-improvements`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Comprehensive codebase improvement initiative focusing on critical test coverage gaps, code deduplication, performance optimization, and type safety improvements."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Achieve Comprehensive Test Coverage for Controllers (Priority: P1)

As a developer maintaining the Eligius codebase, I need comprehensive test coverage for all controllers so that I can confidently refactor and extend controller functionality without introducing regressions.

**Why this priority**: Controllers manage critical UI state and event handling. Without tests, any changes risk breaking user-facing functionality. This directly blocks the 90% coverage requirement and poses the highest risk to system stability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the test suite with coverage reports. Delivers immediate value by catching controller bugs early and enabling safe refactoring of controller logic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** LottieController is untested, **When** comprehensive tests are added covering initialization, animation lifecycle, language changes, and error conditions, **Then** LottieController achieves ≥90% code coverage
2. **Given** NavigationController is untested, **When** tests are added for menu state management, navigation events, and current navigation tracking, **Then** NavigationController achieves ≥90% code coverage
3. **Given** ProgressBarController, RoutingController, and SubtitlesController are untested, **When** comprehensive tests cover their core functionality and edge cases, **Then** all three controllers achieve ≥90% coverage
4. **Given** controller tests are complete, **When** coverage report is generated, **Then** overall controller module coverage is ≥90%

---

### User Story 2 - Complete Missing Operation Tests (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need tests for remove-element and remove-controller-from-element operations so that these critical DOM manipulation operations are validated and safe to use.

**Why this priority**: These operations directly manipulate the DOM and controller lifecycle. Bugs in these operations can cause memory leaks or broken UI. Tests are quick to add and provide immediate safety.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running operation test suite. Delivers value by ensuring DOM cleanup and controller removal work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** remove-element operation has no tests, **When** tests are added covering element removal, empty selections, and cleanup verification, **Then** remove-element achieves ≥90% coverage
2. **Given** remove-controller-from-element operation has no tests, **When** tests are added covering controller removal, cleanup verification, and error conditions, **Then** remove-controller-from-element achieves ≥90% coverage

---

### User Story 3 - Eliminate Property Deletion Code Duplication (Priority: P2)

As a developer maintaining operation files, I need a reusable helper for property deletion so that I don't repeat the same deletion pattern across 28+ operation files.

**Why this priority**: This duplication makes maintenance harder and increases the risk of inconsistent behavior. A helper function centralizes this logic and improves code maintainability significantly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating the helper with comprehensive tests, then refactoring a few operations to use it and verifying behavior is unchanged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 28+ operations manually delete properties using identical patterns, **When** a removeProperties helper is created with comprehensive tests, **Then** the helper correctly removes specified properties and returns typed results
2. **Given** removeProperties helper exists, **When** operations are refactored to use the helper, **Then** all refactored operations maintain identical behavior with less code
3. **Given** operations use the removeProperties helper, **When** future operations need property deletion, **Then** they can use the helper instead of duplicating deletion logic

---

### User Story 4 - Optimize Timeline Performance (Priority: P2)

As a developer optimizing engine performance, I need optimized timeline setup and lookup logic so that engine initialization and playback are faster and more efficient.

**Why this priority**: Performance issues in timeline processing directly impact user experience. These optimizations are low-risk refactorings with measurable performance benefits.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested using performance benchmarks comparing initialization time and timeline lookup speed before and after optimization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** timeline setup iterates over timelines twice, **When** the double loop is consolidated into a single pass, **Then** timeline initialization time is reduced by ~50%
2. **Given** timeline lookups use linear find() searches, **When** a Map-based cache is implemented, **Then** timeline lookup operations are O(1) instead of O(n)
3. **Given** action execution uses recursion, **When** converted to iterative async/await, **Then** deep action chains don't build up call stack and execution is faster

---

### User Story 5 - Standardize Controller Event Management (Priority: P3)

As a developer working with controllers, I need a base controller class with standardized event listener management so that all controllers handle events consistently and avoid memory leaks.

**Why this priority**: Inconsistent event handling creates maintenance burden and memory leak risks. A base class enforces best practices across all controllers.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating BaseController with tests, refactoring one controller to use it, and verifying event cleanup works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** controllers use inconsistent event listener patterns, **When** a BaseController class is created with standardized addListener and cleanup methods, **Then** BaseController provides type-safe event management with automatic cleanup
2. **Given** BaseController exists, **When** controllers extend BaseController, **Then** all controllers use consistent event handling patterns and proper cleanup
3. **Given** controllers use BaseController, **When** detach() is called, **Then** all event listeners are properly removed preventing memory leaks

---

### User Story 6 - Improve Type Safety (Priority: P3)

As a developer maintaining the codebase, I need reduced 'any' type usage in core files so that TypeScript can catch type errors at compile time and provide better IDE support.

**Why this priority**: Type safety prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience. Focusing on core files (eligius-engine.ts, merge-operation-data.ts) provides maximum impact.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by refactoring core files to remove 'any', verifying TypeScript compilation succeeds, and confirming no runtime behavior changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** eligius-engine.ts has excessive 'any' usage, **When** proper types and type guards are added, **Then** TypeScript can catch type errors in engine code
2. **Given** merge-operation-data.ts uses 'any' for data merging, **When** proper generic types are added, **Then** operation data merging is type-safe
3. **Given** core files have improved type safety, **When** developers make changes, **Then** IDE autocomplete works correctly and type errors are caught at compile time

---

### User Story 7 - Optimize LottieController String Replacement (Priority: P3)

As a developer optimizing controller performance, I need efficient label replacement in LottieController so that animation initialization doesn't have O(n²) string manipulation overhead.

**Why this priority**: Current implementation uses split/join in a loop which is inefficient. Regex-based replacement provides measurable performance improvement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested using benchmarks comparing label replacement time with old vs. new implementation for animations with many labels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** LottieController uses split/join in forEach loop for label replacement, **When** implementation is changed to regex-based single-pass replacement, **Then** label replacement is O(n) instead of O(n²)
2. **Given** optimized label replacement is implemented, **When** animation with 100+ labels is initialized, **Then** initialization time is significantly faster

---

### User Story 8 - Fix Memory Leak Risks (Priority: P3)

As a developer ensuring system stability, I need memory leak fixes in global cache and event listener binding so that long-running applications don't accumulate memory.

**Why this priority**: Memory leaks cause gradual performance degradation in long-running apps. Fixes prevent production issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested using memory profiling before and after fixes, verifying memory doesn't accumulate over time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** resolve-property-values cache can accumulate on exceptions, **When** WeakSet is used instead of array or proper cleanup is ensured, **Then** cache doesn't leak memory
2. **Given** event listener binding creates new function references, **When** binding is fixed to use consistent references, **Then** event listeners are properly removed on cleanup

---

### User Story 9 - Add Performance Benchmarks (Priority: P3)

As a developer monitoring system performance, I need performance benchmarks and memory leak detection tests so that I can track performance over time and catch regressions early.

**Why this priority**: Benchmarks provide measurable performance metrics and catch performance regressions before they reach production.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating benchmark suite, running it to establish baseline, and verifying benchmarks fail when performance regresses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no performance benchmarks exist, **When** timeline action execution benchmarks are created, **Then** baseline performance metrics are established
2. **Given** no memory leak tests exist, **When** memory leak detection tests are created, **Then** memory leaks in long-running scenarios are caught
3. **Given** benchmarks and leak tests exist, **When** code changes are made, **Then** performance regressions and memory leaks are detected before merge

### Edge Cases

- What happens when trying to add tests to controllers with complex dependencies (mocking lottie-web, video.js)?
- How does the system handle refactoring operations while ensuring behavior remains identical?
- What happens when performance optimizations are applied to code with existing bugs?
- How does type safety refactoring handle cases where 'any' was intentionally used for flexibility?
- What happens when memory leak fixes are applied to code that depends on current behavior?

3. Refactoring operations to use helper function won't break existing tests
4. Performance optimizations won't introduce subtle behavior changes
5. Type safety improvements won't require changing public API contracts
6. Memory leak fixes can be implemented without breaking dependent code
7. Build tools directory exclusion from coverage is acceptable per project requirements

### Out of Scope

- Deep-copy refactoring in src/util/deep-copy.ts
- Class operation refactoring (add-class, remove-class, toggle-class operations remain unchanged)
- Test duplication refactoring (test utility factories not included)
- Adding tests for build tools directory (src/build/, src/tools/)
- Core engine test suite (eligius-engine.ts integration tests deferred)
- Adding tests to all utility files (focus on controllers and missing operations only)
- Video timeline provider testing (provider currently disabled)
