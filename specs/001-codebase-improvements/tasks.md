# Tasks: Codebase Quality Improvement Initiative

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-codebase-improvements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md
**Feature Branch**: `001-codebase-improvements`

**Tests**: This initiative includes comprehensive test coverage tasks (test-first development required per Constitution Principle I)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. All work maintains 100% backward compatibility verified by existing tests.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Setup/Foundational phases have no story label
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single TypeScript project structure:
- Source: `src/`
- Tests: `src/test/unit/`, `src/test/performance/`
- Config: `vitest.config.ts` at project root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and verification

- [X] T001 Verify Node.js >=20 installed (`node --version`)
- [X] T002 [P] Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- [X] T003 [P] Verify all existing tests pass (`npm test`)
- [X] T004 [P] Verify clean working directory (`git status`)
- [X] T005 Checkout feature branch (`git checkout -b 001-codebase-improvements` or `git checkout 001-codebase-improvements`)

**Checkpoint**: Environment ready for implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before user story implementation

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: These tasks provide shared foundations used across multiple user stories

- [X] T006 Create performance test directory `src/test/unit/performance/`
- [X] T007 Update vitest.config.ts to exclude `src/build/` and `src/tools/` from coverage requirements
- [X] T008 [P] Create test utilities directory `src/test/fixtures/` for mock factories (if not exists)
- [X] T009 [P] Create mock eventbus factory in `src/test/fixtures/eventbus-factory.ts` for controller tests
- [X] T010 [P] Create mock jQuery element factory in `src/test/fixtures/jquery-factory.ts` for controller tests

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-11)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 (P1 priority) can proceed in parallel
  - US3 and US4 (P2 priority) can proceed in parallel after P1 or alongside
  - US5-US9 (P3 priority) can proceed in parallel after P1/P2 or alongside
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Controllers)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Creates BaseController used by US5
- **US2 (Operations)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **US3 (Deduplication)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **US4 (Performance)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **US5 (BaseController)**: Depends on US1 T013 (BaseController creation) - Can proceed in parallel with US1 tests
- **US6 (Type Safety)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **US7 (Lottie Opt)**: Can start after US1 T019 (LottieController tests) - Needs tests for verification
- **US8 (Memory Leaks)**: Partially depends on US5 (BaseController fixes event leaks) - Can start resolve-property-values fix independently
- **US9 (Benchmarks)**: Uses benchmarks from US4/US7, memory tests from US8 - Can run consolidation in parallel

### Within Each User Story

**General Pattern**:
1. Tests FIRST (TDD) - Write failing tests
2. Verify tests FAIL
3. Implementation
4. Verify tests PASS
5. Quality checks
6. Verification

**Parallel Opportunities Within Stories**:
- All test file creation can happen in parallel (marked [P])
- All model/implementation tasks on different files can happen in parallel (marked [P])
- Different controller tests/refactorings can happen in parallel

### Critical Path

Fastest path to completion (assuming serial execution):

1. Setup (T001-T005)
2. Foundational (T006-T010)
3. **US1 Priority 1**: BaseController + Controller tests (T011-T039) - 29 tasks
4. **US2 Priority 1**: Operation tests (T040-T050) - 11 tasks
5. **US3 Priority 2**: Property helper (T051-T090) - 40 tasks
6. **US4 Priority 2**: Performance (T091-T111) - 21 tasks
7. US5-US9 Priority 3: Can be done in any order or skipped for MVP

**MVP Recommendation**: Complete Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2 (Priority 1 stories) = 56 tasks for 90% coverage goal

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Controller Tests)

```bash
# Launch BaseController test writing in parallel with mock factory creation:
Task T011: "Write BaseController.spec.ts"
Task T009: "Create mock eventbus factory" (from Foundational)
Task T010: "Create mock jQuery factory" (from Foundational)

# Launch all controller test file creation in parallel:
Task T016: "Write LottieController.spec.ts"
Task T021: "Write NavigationController.spec.ts"
Task T025: "Write ProgressBarController.spec.ts"
Task T029: "Write RoutingController.spec.ts"
Task T033: "Write SubtitlesController.spec.ts"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Operation Refactoring)

```bash
# After helper is created, launch all operation refactorings in parallel:
Task T063-T086: All 24 operation file refactorings can run simultaneously
# (Each touches a different file with no dependencies)
```

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD workflow**: Tests FIRST (RED) → Implementation (GREEN) → Verify → Quality checks
- **Constitutional compliance**: All tests must pass after EVERY commit (Principle XVI)
- **Coverage requirement**: ≥90% excluding src/build/, src/tools/ (Principle VI)
- **Type checking**: Must pass with strict mode (Principle II)
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing tests must pass (Principle XIX)
- **Verification**: Run quality checks after each user story phase
- **Stop points**: Each user story checkpoint allows independent validation

**Total Tasks**: 187 tasks across 9 user stories + setup/polish
**MVP Tasks**: 56 tasks (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2)
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks for full feature (per original analysis)
