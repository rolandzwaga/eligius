# Specification Quality Checklist: EventBus Type-Safe Refactor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Validation Details**:
- All 18 functional requirements are testable and clearly defined
- 4 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- 8 measurable success criteria that are technology-agnostic
- Edge cases identified with expected handling
- Clear scope boundaries in Non-Goals section
- Dependencies and assumptions documented
- No implementation details (TypeScript/ts-morph mentioned only in Dependencies section, which is acceptable)
