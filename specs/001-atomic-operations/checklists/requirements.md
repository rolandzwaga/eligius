# Specification Quality Checklist: Atomic Operations for Interactive Stories

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Notes

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses entirely on user needs and capabilities without mentioning TypeScript, jQuery, or other implementation technologies
2. **Requirements**: All 36 functional requirements are specific, testable, and implementation-agnostic
3. **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, reliability)
4. **User Stories**: 9 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios covering all operations
5. **Edge Cases**: 9 edge cases identified covering error handling and boundary conditions
6. **Assumptions**: 9 assumptions clearly documented covering browser support, storage, CORS, validation, dates, accessibility, and async patterns

The specification provides sufficient detail for planning and implementation without prescribing technical solutions.
